# Product decision records (PDR)

A PDR records how the library behaves as a site owner, implementor or vendor experiences it.
Test: if the technology stack changed, the PDR would still hold. Technology decisions are ADRs
(`docs/adrs/`). The reasons and rejected options are source material for the library's user
documentation.

Cite as PDR-NNNN. Statuses: Decided, Dropped, Superseded by PDR-NNNN, Amended by PDR-NNNN,
Deferred. Update this index in the same change as any status line.
